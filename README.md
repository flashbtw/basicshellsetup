# basicshellsetup
\
This program is to set up a very simple new program environment on your Linux machine. (still W.I.P)\
It's very simple and straight forward.  
  
Imagine you have a directory named e.g "programs" where my program is in.\
Now, when you execute it, it'll prompt for the project name.\
If you type in e.g "Hello_World" It'll make a "Hello_World" subdirectory in the directory "programs"\
In this subdirectory it'll make an "Hello_World.sh" Bash file with basic setup stuff. It'll also make a config.sh and a link to it in the "Hello_World.sh"
## functionality
The program consists of passing "printf" Output to a file. Nothing special
## future updates
Automatically make a github repository (not sure if it is necessary)
